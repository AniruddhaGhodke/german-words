# My Stories Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview
Migrate story saving from localStorage to MongoDB and create a dedicated "My Stories" page where users can view, manage, and interact with their saved stories in a modern, fancy UI.

## Current State Analysis
- **Current Storage**: Stories are saved to localStorage in `StoryGeneratorModal.jsx` (lines 68-88)
- **Story Structure**: Stories contain `germanStory`, `englishStory`, `id`, `savedAt`, `title`, and associated `selectedWords`
- **Database**: MongoDB connection exists with User model already implemented
- **Authentication**: NextAuth session management is in place

## Task Breakdown

### 1. Database Schema Design
**Goal**: Create a Story model for MongoDB storage

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create `models/story.js` with Story schema
- [ ] Include fields: `userId`, `title`, `germanStory`, `englishStory`, `wordsUsed`, `preferences`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
- [ ] Add indexes for efficient querying by `userId` and `createdAt`
- [ ] Ensure relationship with User model

**Schema Structure**:
```javascript
{
  userId: ObjectId (ref: User),
  title: String,
  germanStory: String,
  englishStory: String,
  wordsUsed: [{ german: String, english: String, type: String }],
  preferences: { length: String, style: String, includeEnglish: Boolean },
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### 2. API Endpoints Development
**Goal**: Create RESTful API for story operations

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create `app/api/stories/route.js` for GET (fetch user stories) and POST (create story)
- [ ] Create `app/api/stories/[id]/route.js` for GET, PUT, DELETE individual stories
- [ ] Implement authentication middleware to ensure users only access their stories
- [ ] Add pagination for stories list (limit 20 per page)
- [ ] Add error handling and validation

**Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/stories` - Get user's stories (with pagination)
- `POST /api/stories` - Create new story
- `GET /api/stories/[id]` - Get specific story
- `PUT /api/stories/[id]` - Update story
- `DELETE /api/stories/[id]` - Delete story

### 3. Update Story Generation Flow
**Goal**: Modify StoryGeneratorModal to save to MongoDB instead of localStorage

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Replace localStorage logic with API call to POST `/api/stories`
- [ ] Update `handleSaveStory` function in `StoryGeneratorModal.jsx`
- [ ] Add loading state during save operation
- [ ] Update success/error messages
- [ ] Include user session data for story ownership
- [ ] Remove localStorage migration (optional: migrate existing localStorage stories)

### 4. My Stories Page Creation
**Goal**: Create a modern, fancy UI for viewing and managing stories

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create `app/my-stories/page.jsx` with authentication protection
- [ ] Design modern card-based layout for story display
- [ ] Implement story preview with truncated content
- [ ] Add story metadata display (creation date, word count, style, etc.)
- [ ] Create responsive grid layout (1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 3 col desktop)
- [ ] Add empty state when no stories exist
- [ ] Implement loading skeletons during data fetch

**UI Features**:
- Story cards with preview, metadata, and action buttons
- Fancy hover effects and animations (using framer-motion)
- Filter/sort options (by date, style, length)
- Search functionality
- Pagination or infinite scroll

### 5. Header Navigation Update
**Goal**: Add "My Stories" link to the navigation

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Update `components/Header.jsx` to include "My Stories" link
- [ ] Add link only for authenticated users
- [ ] Style consistently with existing navigation buttons
- [ ] Position appropriately in the navigation flow

### 6. Story Display Component
**Goal**: Create a component for displaying full stories with word context

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create `components/StoryViewer.jsx` or similar for full story display
- [ ] Show story metadata prominently (title, creation date, words used)
- [ ] Display words used as badges/tags above the story
- [ ] Include both German and English versions with language toggle
- [ ] Add pronunciation feature integration (reuse from StoryGeneratorModal)
- [ ] Include story preferences info (length, style, etc.)

**Story Context Display**:
- **Header**: Story title, creation date, preferences (length, style)
- **Words Section**: Visual display of words used with German → English translations
- **Story Content**: Toggle between German/English with highlighted vocabulary
- **Actions**: Read aloud, export, delete

### 7. Story Management Features
**Goal**: Add CRUD operations for story management

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement delete functionality with confirmation modal
- [ ] Add export functionality (reuse from StoryGeneratorModal)
- [ ] Create edit/rename story title feature
- [ ] Add duplicate story option
- [ ] Implement bulk operations (select multiple stories)

### 8. Migration Strategy
**Goal**: Handle existing localStorage stories

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create migration utility to move localStorage stories to MongoDB
- [ ] Run migration on first visit to My Stories page
- [ ] Clear localStorage after successful migration
- [ ] Handle migration errors gracefully

### 9. Performance Optimizations
**Goal**: Ensure good performance with many stories

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement server-side pagination
- [ ] Add client-side caching with SWR or React Query
- [ ] Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- [ ] Add loading states and skeleton screens
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for large lists (if needed)

### 10. Testing & Polish
**Goal**: Ensure feature works reliably

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Test story creation flow end-to-end
- [ ] Test story viewing and management features
- [ ] Test responsive design on different screen sizes
- [ ] Test authentication edge cases
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios
- [ ] Add proper loading and error states

## Technical Considerations

### Security
- Ensure stories are only accessible by their owners
- Validate all inputs on both client and server
- Use NextAuth session for authentication
- Sanitize story content if needed

### Performance
- Implement pagination to avoid loading too many stories
- Use efficient MongoDB queries with proper indexes
- Consider caching frequently accessed stories
- Optimize images and animations

### UX/UI Design
- Modern card-based design with subtle shadows and hover effects
- Smooth animations using framer-motion
- Consistent color scheme with existing app
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Intuitive navigation and clear call-to-actions

### Database Design
- Efficient indexing on `userId` and `createdAt`
- Consider story size limits
- Proper error handling for database operations
- Connection pooling for better performance
